2 @EugeneMayevski'EldoSCorp If it's not about programming then why direct someone to Programmers?  License questions are allowed at programmers but this question wouldn't fit there either.

0 This would be hard even if you had programming skills. How about setting a password instead, so only trusted people can work with it?

2 actually this is a technical question about a code bug so it is a fit for SO, not programmers.SE.

2 @GladstoneKeep - This question wouldn't be a good fit on Programmers either.  In essence, it's a toolset implementation question ("How do I make Foo do blah?") which is off-topic on Progs.

0 :-))) I agree with you somewhat. I've migrated to Java then Scala after C++11. Actually C++ is now too complex and too broad for single language - this results 'several languages in one'. But reality is - C programmers often learn C++ and (which makes the deal) then they return to C and become real programmers - after this they start to be language-agnostic. :-|  Roman Nikitchenko 1 min ago

0 Stack Overflow is a Question and Answer site for programmers, not a  code-writing service, you need a freelance programmer for that.

0 @Akarienta This is true, but it doesn't help when someone simply doesn't know the functions to use yet. This could have been a two word solution of concatMap show, it's simply learning the API. The actual problem solved here was learning about previously unknown functions in Prelude. It's not that OP needed to adapt a more complex problem to fit his needs, it's merely ignorance of an existing solution. Yes, programmers need to learn how to read documentation and follow similar problems, but I'm going to wager that you didn't know about concatMap when you first started using Haskell.  bheklilr 10 secs ago

0 For some of us that computer science class was a long time ago (like 35 years) and we haven't used terminology like l_i such that j, P[j]= T [i+j-1] + l_i since then. Could you, perhaps, rephrase your question in English?

0 Yes, we regularly run into the situation on our development server, we usually have many programmers accessing the same DB for development purposes. So if I add new columns to a table and update a sproc to use them, I make the new parameters all optional, so I don't break the app for other developers who aren't running my new code yet. As long as you're just adding and not deleting or restructuring, that can work fine.

You can call it nitpicky if you want, but if you're going to communicate with other programmers and ask for your help, you need to learn to communicate properly. That means giving a complete question, showing what you're starting with, showing what you've tried, and explaining how the things you've tried don't work.  mason 7 secs ago

0 @VikasVerma Why are arrays not like objects? Because of history. When Java was designed, most attempts at language innovation failed when not similar to C in syntax and style. Thus C++, Objective-C, and Java were among the few languages to survive obscurity during that era. Java was consciously designed to include curly braces, primitive, and plain arrays to be familiar to mainstream programmers of the day. See interviews with James Gosling and other Sun folks. Some people stick with Collections rather than arrays for pure OOP.  Basil Bourque 11 secs ago

0 Kritner, per the help center, this is a legitimate SO question (though perhaps not a good one): Stack Overflow is for professional and enthusiast programmers, people who write code because they love it. We feel the best Stack Overflow questions have a bit of source code in them, but if your question generally covers      a specific programming problem, or     a software algorithm, or     software tools commonly used by programmers; and is     a practical, answerable problem that is unique to software development   then youre in the right place to ask your question!

0 You might want to familiarize yourself with some basic C# concepts so you can rephrase your question in a way other programmers can understand.

0 @MadProgrammer again, I'm not disagreeing with you. If you want someone to understand a problem, simply telling them "this is how you should do it" and not providing the full background does them no good. We keep the answers to questions on SO relevant to the question being asked, and we see lots of questions that have very simple answers to professional programmers. So, when we answer questions, we do so, in the best possible way to solve the problem at hand, and leave the it could be done better to the asker to figure out.  Ryan J 1 min ago
0 @SurenderThakran it shows that the candidate understands JavaScript functions at a deeper level than its similarities to other programming languages. If they don't know how to use arguments or how to invoke functions with more control then it suggests they may be a JS novice (no matter how capable they are at programming in general).

However, having no idea about when it's best to use a Task vs Thread, or when should I use a delegate, or any of those types of things makes learning impossible.  I can hack something together yes.  It will be the most willy nilly code that is awful to read, have no real design flow, but will work.  Am I to understand that is how you all code as well?

0 Maybe not in terms of LOC, but in writing-time context. While using external files(xml for example) you have to open this file, write down the class name, and xml tags.

So I don't have to search for proper config file, copy existing entry and modify it to new repository.   Someone wrote words of wisdom - Programmers are lazy guys.  Warzyw 1 min ago

0 @iharob C++ programmers are only less skilled (whatever that means) because to write C++ you don't have to go as low-level as you must in C. But you definitely can go if you want.

0 This is my opinion, but you should learn c, if you go learn c++ first, then you will never need to understand pointers and how to work directly with memory, for instance if you learn the std::string class then you will never understand how is a string really represented in memory, usually c++ only programmers are less skilled, for what I know.  iharob 56 secs ago

0 @Lrrr I agree with what you said above. But questions like this can speed up learning by following paths that other programmers have treaded and found to be more useful than others. A case like this where we have to restrict ourselves from sharing our experiences and opinions undermines the capabilities of such a powerful community we have.  Meena Chaudhary 2 mins ago

0 AB is a hex number, normally written by C programmers as 0xAB. The hex number A has bit pattern 1010, and B is 1011, so together they are 10101011. If you separate the different items in that bit pattern, you have 1 010 10 1 1 in binary, which is 1 2 2 1 1 in decimal.  user3386109 1 min ago

0 @cmaster For a library, it's not necessarily to give all header files to library users. Hence, you could publish X.h but not Ximpl.h. For development purposes, you can keep X.h in some common header folder (structure), and Ximpl.h closer to the source files. Within a project, I don't see how putting something in a source file helps protecting it, as opposed to putting it in a header file. Both can be modified by programmers with sufficient access rights.  dyp 55 secs ago

0 This would be much better off on Statalist. There is no attempt at code here so it is not a good programming question for Stack Overflow. The advertised community here is professional and enthusiast programmers; it is not a forum to field any conceivable question about software use. Further, my guess is that the answer requires statistical thinking and you would reach a much wider audience in that respect on Statalist.

0 @dyp Yes, I understand the effect of the dependency reduction. The protection of the class implementation is achieved by never handing the implementation class' definition to a user of the code. He can't mess around with data members he doesn't know that they exist. Of course, this protection is only of real importance when the class is part of a library. Within a project, a private should be enough to keep programmers of other classes away from it (and if it's not, you should keep the programmers away from your code).  cmaster 39 secs ago

0 @malcolmhall the (0,0) coordinate is actually a valid coordinate. Saying it is invalid might mislead some developers. However, it usually comes about as a result of some error resulting in the (0,0) coordinate. For example [anNSNumber floatValue] will return 0 if the instance is nil. But because there is nothing of interest at (0,0) most programmers are willing to mark it as invalid to identify these errors.  pnizzle 1 min ago

You mention "useful and correct" information....let me point something out to you...  Experience in cryptology will tell you that there is no such thing as a one way cipher.

0 Programmers generally want to rewrite things from scratch.  That usually ends badly.   Whatever sins the old code contains, it presumably addresses an implicit set of requirements.  Rewrite the code doesn't make sense if you don't know the requirements, and without looking at the old code, it is pretty hard to guess that set. (Even looking at the old code it is hard to guess, but if  you repair it, you don't have to know the requirements as well; they're [by definition] already addressed.

0 Yeah it is something that can easily bite newcomers as well as experienced programmers. Therefore it is better to avoid such issues. I just thought of another issue when using an array. You did not initialise word via e.g. char word[20] = {'\0'}; therefore its value is undefined. If you are on linux press CTRL+D when entering a word. This results in EOF and std::cin not reading in anything and keeping word unchanged. Now even though you did not read anything in you will most still likely enter the while-loop. std::string combined with an std::string::empty check avoids this.  mat69 39 secs ago

0 From that page: While writing an application, a programmer will recompile and test often, and so compilation must be fast. This is one reason most optimizations are deliberately avoided during the test/debugging phase. Also, program code is usually "stepped through" (see Program animation) using a symbolic debugger, and optimizing transformations, particularly those that reorder code, can make it difficult to relate the output code with the line numbers in the original source code. This can confuse both the debugging tools and the programmers using them.  Steve 7 secs ago

If an pf suffix indicates "precise float", then the value 1111111.1xf would be rejected, but 111111.125xf would be accepted.

For example, if you are developing a map, it might not initially occur to you that you need to provide a method to enumerate all elements in the map, but while writing the tests (and before you have written any map code) you will inevitably realize that you need to be able to enumerate the elements in order to figure out whether the map actually contains the test elements that you are adding to it.

0 +1 for "IF NOT EXIST" as a robust way for apps to ensure that tables exist without risk of disturbing extant database contents.

0 @user3905353 - Just wanted to add a little more context to my previous comment.  SO is designed to help solve programming problems and build a library of answers to help solve them.  In this instance the problem you posted how to solve "syntax error, unexpected tIVAR, expecting end-of-input" is solved by adding the missing "end"statements.  Other novice programmers who search SO for similar problems will not be able to solve it by simply removing class and method definitions as this solution dictates.  This simply is not a real world solution to the problem you posted.  heading_to_tahiti 45 secs ago

Then I realized I didn't have enough space in one of them, but if I scaled all of them a bit smaller, but still comfortable to read.

0 As stackoverflow has grown it's unfortunate that overmoderation has killed what are actually helpful questions.  This was not an unreasonable or overly general question, and it's one many programmers would reasonable ask and want a community answer on. Classifying this as too general may be a fun exercise of moderator power, but actions like that relegate stackoverflow to answering questions related to minutae rather than questions which are actually helpful.  I note that many of the most popular (and useful) questions on SO would be closed as too general by today's overzealous moderators.  tohster 1 min ago

0 A lot of the Office indexers return a value of type object, roughly equivalent to the .NET 1.x collection objects like ArrayList.  Which maps to __ComObject, the RCW for a COM interface.  It has no get_Range() method, only the strongly typed interface does.  Using Range invokes the late-bound property getter.  You'd have to cast to WorkSheet to use get_Range().  Which is not uncommon, breaking up such a long statement is desirable and many programmers like the IntelliSense hints.  Hans Passant 1 min ago

0 Note that it is a good idea to drop the inline from static inline: With static the compiler already knows that the given function is only ever used in the given translation unit and can make a better choice about inlining it than the programmer who adds the inline to the definition. Too much inlining hurts performance as much as too little inlining, and most programmers who add the inline keyword do not know or test whether inlining that function will indeed speed things up. Of course, if your tests(!) show that static inline is faster than static, go ahead and use it :-)  cmaster 2 mins ago

0 I really don't care to write code to be readable by developers that can't understand something they don't expect. More relevant is whether or not it is a good idea to begin with despite what other developers might expect. If it is a good idea, good developers will be capable of comprehending, appreciating, and even adopting it. Now I'm not promoting the code in the original question, but I personally do something that shares something in common with it, and it does not conform to what other programmers expect or promote as good practice.

0 Which again makes it clear how useless __del__ is. For instance, if I where to use objects of a mutex guard class, I couldn't do the unlocking in the guard class's __del__ method, because it's not enough to know that __del__ will get called when ever the GC feels like doing its job ... I need to mutex released right when the guard object "goes out of scope" (I know that's stretching it, given Python's scoping rules). IMO __del__ gives programmers the false impression that RAII in Python is doable via destructors when it really isn't. You have to use context managers for that.  antred 23 secs ago

0 @DanielA.White Are you sure?  I recall asking similar questions over there in the past and they pushed it back to Stack Overflow because it was about setting up a programmers environment.  Is there official policy on this?
0 @Akarienta This is true, but it doesn&#39;t help when someone simply doesn&#39;t know the functions to use yet. This could have been a two word solution of `concatMap show`, it&#39;s simply learning the API. The actual problem solved here was learning about previously unknown functions in Prelude. It&#39;s not that OP needed to adapt a more complex problem to fit his needs, it&#39;s merely ignorance of an existing solution. Yes, programmers need to learn how to read documentation and follow similar problems, but I&#39;m going to wager that you didn&#39;t know about `concatMap` when you first started using Haskell.

First of all, you've put <code>&quot;FldPath &amp; picture.png&quot;</code> inside of a string, which means it will be interpreted as a string, and not concatenated. Second, setting objects to <code>Nothing</code> is worthless in VB.NET. It is an old practice from VB 6, carried over by cargo-cult programmers. The third problem is similar: calling <code>GC.Collect()</code> is generally a bad idea unless you're doing some specific kind of performance testing. It doesn't belong in production code without a very good reason. It is certainly not something that you call &quot;just to be safe&quot; or whatever. —
0 @SergeyA All your &quot;never&quot;'s only apply to low-skilled programmers, who find it easier to learn a thousand of &quot;never&quot;-rules instead of learning how C++ works. Not all C++ programmers are <i>that</i> silly. —
0 @ErikAlap&auml;&auml; There almost certainly exists no case where you would want to use signed integers together with hex notation literals. All it will cause is subtle bugs and head ache. This is actually a huge problem for the embedded industry, when naive PC programmers try to write hardware programming C code, with their ints and floats. —
1 @henrikgiesel: Crap questions are still crap even if they are on-topic. <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com">Programmers</a> gets enough crap questions organically, sending even more is not productive. —
2 @henrikgiesel blatant homework types of problems will be poorly received on programmers. This is basically a &quot;how do I code&quot; question and not at all a practically answerable question. —
0 I wanted to know a bit of both. Internal differences in the way they process information (performance, etc.) and best practices (if there is any) to write code that is both useful and nice to other programmers. —
0 NO I never said that parentheses are needed, I meant only, that some programmers use them in expressions before returning it. —
0 While this is certainly a better way to do it, I think it's still better in this case to focus on fixing the code he's written, rather than suggesting he scrap it and do it a simpler way. What he's trying to do is a common idiom--where you go through a loop, but have to keep track of whether you've found something and then check <i>after</i> the loop. And it's an idiom that a lot of newer programmers get wrong. I think it's important that he learn how to do the idiom right. —
0 Programmers can confuse any thing from smallest to biggest. I don't really care you believe or not, that what I know so I contribute my knowledge to every one. Public these rules is violate the right/policy, if you want I can send you through your private contact :) —
0 I don't believe programmers will confuse <code>#define TRUE !FALSE</code> to &quot;think that TRUE represents every value which [is] not 0&quot;. The not operator is trivial and doesn't work that way in any language. The concept of a thing which is &quot;every value which is not X&quot; doesn't even exist in C. If there is such a rule about defining true and false I think you're misinterpreting the rationale behind it. They likely don't want coders defining their own booleans at all and to instead use <code>stdbool.h</code>. —
0 I would appreciate if legitimate, if ignorant, questions weren't downvoted, as it prevents new users from asking questions, and delays new user's access to the features that allow them to contribute. Remember that most advice is not detailed enough to help new programmers, so unless you already know that, for example, slice() is a method for functions, not strings, you will never find out by googling. —
0 There are multiple Varients or taste or <code>design Pattern</code> used by multiple programmers now a days. So Implement as per your need. —
0 There are bad and good programmers, my friend. —
2 This question is off-topic here, as it has nothing to do with programming or programmers tools. This is a server related issue.

0 But that is the problem, premature optimization, per Don Knuth: &quot;The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.&quot; Kent Beck: “Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work” —
0 @Marco_D please clarify why this is not what you wanted. When talking about bits, &quot;first&quot; and &quot;last&quot; is confusing. In machine terms &quot;first bit&quot; means bit 0 which is the lowest bit. Programmers usually follow this convention. If you want year to be placed to the &quot;top&quot; or &quot;most significant&quot; bits then please edit the question to reflect such. —
0 I thought you'd be interested in extending your knowledge. I'm not here for points or to &quot;show off&quot; but for learning, helping and solving problems in an efficient way. You talk from code that &quot;ordinary programmers&quot; understand but use regex yourself with recursion, <code>\K</code>, lookahead, shorthands, free spacing mode (for whatever reason)... without explaining much about how your patterns work. And why I'm critical with your answer? Because you seem to be extremely critical about others that use and explain techniques that might not be basic regex, but are well-established nowadays. Farewell. —
0 oops, sorry to post in the wrong place. I was going off the help screen:We feel the best Stack Overflow questions have a bit of source code in them, but if your question generally covers... a specific programming problem a software algorithm software tools commonly used by programmers matters that are unique to the programming profession ...then you're in the right place to ask your question! —
0 accelerate and deaccelerate just change the speed. But I fixed this by creating a bool called collided and if you hit the wall it is set to true and if you hit the wall while collided is true and going forward you will go backwards and opposite if going backwards. This also fixed my collision problem that I had where the car glitches through the wall. Thanks anyways :) I love speaking to other programmers. —

0 Hmm so they would serialize as A&lt;B&lt;C&lt;D&lt;Point&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but deserialize to D&lt;B&lt;C&lt;A&lt;Point&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ? This can work if you deserialize simply to Point*. It will not only read fields correctly but instantiate the right class for you. Or do you mean serializing A&lt;B&lt;C&gt; &gt; &gt; and deserializing to D&lt;E&lt;F&gt; &gt; &gt; and common base class is absolutely prohibited? As long as there's a common base you can read to the base pointer and it will not only get it right but instantiate the correct type. The latter admittedly has to be introduced by BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_GUID - not a problem for programmers. Who's your audience? —

0 @bobblebubble: |I can't help but think you're just showing off here. You and I know what the star commands do, but you're asking someone to put them in code that probably several others will have to maintain, and they are not common knowledge. I've written my solution by dividing the problem into parts and solving them separately. Even so I had to write stuff that I'm not comfortable with, and I am still certain that a proper parser is the correct solution. You're not &quot;special&quot; if you can't come up with code that ordinary programmers can understand —

0 ...neither assumption would hold for independent structures with different fixed array sizes. I have no problem with the idea that when programming constructs exist to do things that programmers need to do, programmers should use such structures rather than nasty hacks. On the other hand, I do have a problem with the idea that a language should forbid hacks to do things which need to be done, and for which the language provides no non-hacky alternative. —
0 Are programmers discouraged from altering the response, since there is no API function that allows one to do this directly? Dumping and resetting the JSON seems to be an inefficient way of adding just one key. —

0 This boils down to philosophy. Let's take <code>if</code> statement from C. Most people say it is dangerous not to put braces around it. Yet, it is really aesthetically pleasing not to put them. I know a person that never puts them and had 0 bugs connected to it. Braceless if is in the grammar for a reason, the same goes to read-string. It all boils down to cost vs. perceived danger, which is always subjective. You can invent &quot;golden rules&quot; to guide novice programmers, but they are not universally true even if most people adhere to them. —
0 <i>I solved it easily using array lists.</i> -- Yes, but if I were to look at your solution at first glance (and were not told what problem you were trying to solve), I would have to decipher all of those loops and if-else statements to see &quot;ok, he is trying to find the uncommon elements&quot;. However, if I (and other C++ programmers) were to take a look at code that calls <code>set_difference</code>, we know immediately what is being done. Not only that, algorithms <b>never</b> fail if given the right input parameters, thus no debugging is necessary. —

0 Sure, no problem. If you are just learning C, spending a hour or two to fully digest the <code>scanf</code> and <code>printf</code> <i>man pages</i> is time will-spent. It will save you tens of hours in the long run. The <code>scanf</code>/<code>printf</code> family of tools are a cornerstone of C (though you should lean toward <code>fgets</code> rather than <code>scanf</code> for input most of the time). Taking time to understand them (especially <code>scanf</code>) is necessary and is probably what causes a bulk of confusion for new C programmers. Keep up the good work. —

0 @KenWhite: Many earlier languages had integer overflow trapping. The present state of C represents the worst of all possible worlds if one is designing applications which have <i>any</i> sort of behavioral requirement on inputs which could cause overflow, since C lacks the ability to express overflow-avoidance code in a way that would grant compilers the same level of flexibility they would have if the language semantics were defined slightly better such that programmers with loose requirements wouldn't <i>have</i> to write overflow avoidance code. For example, if a function is... —
0 And what have you tried? Please understand that StackOverflow is not a code writing service. If you'd like someone to write that code for you, know that there are many programmers willing to do that, and sometimes they will request to be reimbursed for their services to you. —

1 Thank you @zero323, the programmers forum seems more appropriate. As for your question: While I haven't tried anything specific yet, but I do have a general constraint: I want to use Spark as much as possible. For example, for data parallelism, I want to continue to use Spark. So the architectural degrees of freedom are mainly with regards to the choice of task-parallelization strategy. If this was pure task parallelism, I would have gone with any standard cluster manager software, but since there is a gather phase, and potentially more complex control flow, I need something more ML-aware. —
0 Quoting <code>MIPS32TM Architecture For Programmers Volume II: The MIPS32TM Instruction Set</code>, <code>BNE: An 18-bit signed offset (the 16-bit offset field shifted left 2 bits) is added to the address of the instruction following the branch (not the branch itself), in the branch delay slot, to form a PC-relative effective target address. If the contents of GPR rs and GPR rt are not equal, branch to the effective target address after the instruction in the delay slot is executed.</code> —

0 My test was to tell programmers that if they're choosing <code>===</code> for performance reasons, they're wrong. So programmers are free to choose <code>===</code> or <code>==</code> based on logical reasons but not on performance reasons: there are different cases to prefer the one or the other and performance must not be taken into account at all. —
0 The lonely app.js is just to define the module and define dependencies that might exist at the application level. Lazy programmers put all of the dependencies there, but you really should declare those as far down the hierarchy as possible. Yes, you are correct, pass temp as a parameter. —
0 Don't use <code>Enum.ordinal()</code>. Quoting the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Enum.html#ordinal()" rel="nofollow">Javadoc</a>: &quot;Most programmers will have no use for this method. It is designed for use by sophisticated enum-based data structures, such as EnumSet and EnumMap.&quot;. See also Effective Java for a detailed description of why not to use it, e.g. fragility. Plus, the default implementation of <code>Enum.toString()</code> produces the same output already. —
0 Is this a blog post? Most programmers don't have a C++ template that can work well with only a void*. The point of a template is to <i>not</i> use void*. —
0 Everybody likes a standard, it helps programmers to create libraries that run on multiple platforms. Already having 5 very different versions of the standard, no concrete tooling support yet and several platforms lagging badly behind, well, not so much. System.String is core, everybody has to implement it. A class like MessageQueue or Window is not. This probably won't start to pay off until at least a year from now. —
0 @JonSkeet thanks for the ref - I had no idea the spec defined that (and it seems a bizarre definition). Is this specifically so that compilers don't have to do static analysis? Is there some other reason? And ... given the spec is written this way, it would seem there is strong need for a directive/something that lets programmers say &quot;no, you are wrong. If you were to analyse the syntax in more detail, you'd see it. I have. Trust me. Please!&quot; —
0 @fge googling I only found it may be problematic if it is not used properly. Althought the ProcessBuilder is newer and more convenient, I couldn't find any problem with Runtime.exec other than wrong usages by programmers —
0 Presumptuous nonsense. What are these &quot;pre-cleanup instructions&quot; you keep imagining? &quot;I never really read the part of the official ISO C++ standard that specifies this&quot;: you seemingly didn't read any relevant bit as there is none; you are daydreaming falsehoods. C/C++ don't do GC as it would hinder performance for good programmers who don't do stupid things like trying to continue using destructed objects (&amp; anyone who cares can implement it themselves). How did you manage to translate 'I have not bothered to research whether this exists' into 'This does exist, but who knows how it works, lol' —

0 @NikBougalis &quot;1980s programming&quot; was a polite way of saying incredibly poor API design, obviously made by the kind of 80s programmers that got all excited by obfuscation and complexity. To create a process which contains all the needless overhead of its parent and to use the same source code for two unrelated purposes is &quot;flat out silly&quot;. Anyone with a hint of common sense would agree. <code>fork()</code> is a remain from an era long before multi-threading was invented. I'm hardly a Unix guru, but I believe the correct way to start a new process nowadays would be <code>posix_spawn</code> and similar sane functions. —
0 I like to add that this is a programmer personal thing, I personally like to create &quot;islands&quot; of classes. Each does it own thing and has a proper interface to the rest of the program. But some programmers like to do everything on the outside. —

0 Let me explain: I am really disappointed by (the majority on SO) Perl programmers' attitude to one-regex solutions. If a linear pattern is possible, there is no point in splitting it. Especially like here, when you need to match the whole string. (I will remove this in 3 minutes). —
0 Yes, thanks, I just edited first post, duDE answered that a few hours ago but it was since deleted. The problem is that I'm fairly new to vbs and don't get this as fast as programmers would, i'm feeling miserible, already 6 hours I'm on a simple txt write script.

0 I don't think this question is off-topic. Azure HDInsight is a tool that programmers use. (I don't, so I have no idea about the Spark version there. Even 1.5.2 is pretty old.) —
0 @Crashalot not sure what you mean by 'solve this'? It depends on the purpose you have in mind when you obtain screen resolution. As far as programmers are concerned, Jman012's answer is correct and you render into a 1242x2208 or 2208x1242 space. Heck, that's even the resolution we provide launch images at. The fact that the hardware then down samples this image and displays it on a physical screen with a smaller pixel count would be an 'implementation detail' our code shouldn't even be aware of. —

0 You do not seem to have a programming question here. Stack Overflow is a Q&amp;A site for programmers, but you can probably get help at one of our sister sites -- <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/">unix.stackexchange.com</a> or perhaps <a href="https://superuser.com/">superuser.com</a> for general computer help. Flag your question for moderator attention and request a migration to a suitable site (after checking that a similar question doesn't already exist there, of course; and do check their site policy to verify that your question is acceptable there). —
0 PEAR is a lost cause. It is bloated and full of dependencies. Exactly what Object Oriented code should not be. Serious programmers do not use PEAR which has gone pear shape over the years. You can write your own pager in 30 minutes flat if you know how to write code. Tip: the pager should never produce HTML code. It should instead put the result of its calculations into an array and let another class produce the HTML. That's a good starting point. —

0 @markets I don't know about shortcuts but the JIT can certainly take advantage over CPU features ON THE FLY without ever recompiling the program and I don't see why C++ would win over other languages just because it's a system language. you have this thinking that because other languages are more usable than a price needs to be payed, it's bullshit, assembler programmers told the same things to C programmers in the old days and compilers today are able to produce the same level of optimization, sometimes even better but certainly worst at rare times. —

0 I would say that the semantic equivalence of <code>npos</code> to <code>NULL</code> for functions like <code>string::find</code> <i>vs</i> their C ancestors like <code>strstr</code> and <code>strchr</code> could have made it much more attractive for C programmers to adopt C++. —

0 @Amit: Until OP intervenes, we'll have to agree to differ. I understand that the expression is an expression, and that seems to me 100% consistent with the question as to whether the expression will be evaluated more than once. Of course, it is obvious to you and me that it will be evaluated only once, but na&iuml;ve programmers get confused by the three-expression <code>for</code> where the middle (test) expression is evaluated every time. In JS that's normal, but it is very common for beginner C programmers to be chastised for <code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; strlen(s); ++i)</code>, for example. —

0 1) Name munging would be more extensive on the static interface, necessarily involving signatures. It is what Stroustrup did no his macro front end. In the case of providing alternative branches into the specialization tree, as inc-a has done here, one could simply suffix them by branch identifier. (Your proposed solution also introduced a new symbol.) 2) The static interface does not support dynamic operations, it also introduces two flavors of oo in the same system. It is not a valid argument that programmers don't need dynamic oo, especially when we already chose to use CLOS. —

0 I understand - just saying it's contentious - some programmers will use the term the way you suggest, and others will think you're making a poorly-phrased mention of abstract classes. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15253642/what-is-the-difference-between-abstract-class-and-pure-abstract-class-in-c">here</a> for a question that shows how the term is not universally understood. —

0 @LukeHuang SO is not a programming service. It is a Q/A site for programmers to work as a community. It is taken as a given that users will make an effort to <b>learn</b> programming. Based on your comments, I'm not convinced you are trying. Take the time to learn what an anonymous function is and how to use and modify them. —
0 @CuriousOne: almost. Understand that we the programmers do not have full complete control over when or if paint or paintComponent get called, which is why I specifically stated &quot;<i>request&quot;</i> above. If too many repaint requests get stacked up, not all of them will result in painting calls. It makes sense. —
0 Reason these types are not commonly used is likely just lazy programmers (like me) and redundancy, as the standard types actually are much the same. —
0 @Andy In C (and C++), it is both common and good practice to reverse operands like that, to avoid typos. <code>if (NULL = myVar)</code> fails to compile and is instantly caught, whereas <code>if (myVar = NULL)</code> creates a bug that may be difficult to track down depending on what other code is around it. Modern compilers should give you a warning, but many experienced C programmers have already developed the habit of swapping the order. —
0 @2501, the fact that a programmer can work around <code>const</code> is not really the point of this question or the answer. The point of this question and answer is what C syntax can be used to communicate to other programmers as well as the compiler that a particular global variable is to only be changed by specific pieces of code and every where else the variable is not to be modified and to communicate this in a way that allows the C compiler to perform some checks and while maintaining Defined Behavior. Particular C syntax has particular meanings or semantics even if the meaning can be subverted. —
0 yes, this is the solution I've already mentioned in my question. The downfall is that this invokeFunction is not very comfortable to deal with. If you call it like InvokeFunction ('PostProductFunction', $someParams) ; then you must keep in mind that there is a class PostProductFunction in advance. If you use an IDE, it cannot help you with hints, it's easy to make a typo,and it's hard for other programmers to know what kind of strind they should pass, whether it should be the classname or some part of it,or some key in some array, or something else. Maybe there's a way to make it more pleasant —

0 @PJTraill I must admit I cannot state any of the above with certainty as I only have part of the source code of the library and some documentation written by an apprentice 10 years ago.

0 @PeterA.Schneider And for the better of a generation (and more) warnings have either been casted to silence or generally ignored, both by newbies and experienced programmers alike. Because hey, the compiler finished and created a program so it must work right? —
0 You appear to have a network issue with a tool that may occasionally be used by programmers. This isn't exactly related to programming as such. <b>Ignoring that</b> though, your questions is open ended (<i>Is anyone else having this trouble</i>) and vague. It's likely unanswerable in it's current form and even if someone did answer it (<i>yes, I'm also having trouble</i>) it would immediately by useless to anyone else. SO is a Q&amp;A repository of useful information. Your question is a forum (<i>I'd like to participate in a discussion</i>) type question. —
0 &quot;software tools commonly used by programmers&quot;? Or am I missing something? —
0 @bgusach: My <i>guess</i> is that the downvotes are due to lack of research, since <code>dict.items</code> is pretty easy to find in the docs. OTOH, I suppose the official Python docs can be a bit intimidating if Python is your first programming language, since they are aimed at seasoned programmers. —
2 @tyress: This question is too broad for Programmers. &quot;What is the process of object oriented analysis and design&quot; is the subject of an entire book, not a Q&amp;A. —
1 This question is better suited for (programmers)[<a href="https://programmers.stackexchange.com/]">programmers.stackexchange.com/]</a>. Read #5 of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic">stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic</a> —
0 Welcome to Stack Overflow. Stack Overflow is not a coding service. It exists to help programmers with specific questions related to programming, not complete projects. —
0 @HovercraftFullOfEels this question is a <i>very</i> poor fit for Programmers - it would be quickly voted down and closed over there, see <a href="http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/a/6630/31260">How do I explain ${something} to ${someone}?</a> Recommended reading: <b><a href="http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/q/7182/31260">What goes on Programmers.SE?

0 @zman419: You should have specified this in the question. C programmers tend to think of numbers as <code>int</code> rather than <code>double</code>. I changed the example. —
0 @chux: I'd argue that it would have the opposite effect. At present, 99% of production C code relies upon features which are common to many platforms, but for which there is no &quot;official&quot; Standard. If something can be written in a way which abides by the Standard, or in a way which is clearer and on some implementations faster, and will work on 99.9999% of existing implementations, but which the Standard considers UB, would it be better for programmers to use the first way, or for the Standard to acknowledge the behavior which 99.9999% of implementations already support? —
0 I like this idea yet see a large down side of portability: There are lots of non-gcc C compiler's (and programmers), including maybe one of OP's, that would need to re-write/<code>#ifdef</code> code. —
0 Any hack like that would drain the precious battery power of the watch, so I hope that Apple makes sure it's not available to application programmers. —
0 Close voter: Please note that <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" rel="nofollow">docker compose</a> is a programming tool used by devops to programmatically build development environments. It evolved from <a href="http://www.fig.sh/" rel="nofollow">fig</a> whose stated purpose is &quot;Fast, isolated development environments&quot;. It is a tool for programmers, and therefore on topic. —
0 Great. Glad to be of help (at least with your initial problem). You can accept the answer if it helped you as other programmers looking up this question may find it useful. —
0 I'm looking at this from a simple coding standpoint, finding values for keys is simply not complicated. I didn't look at the gettext src yet, it might not be as easy without extending the parser, since it probably wasn't made with JSON in mind, but you'll excuse me for naively thinking you lesser programmers may have done that already, some time in the past 21 years ;-) —
0 The library you are trying to use was targeted primarily to C# and VB.NET programmers. You can use it from C++ as well but that requires the C++/CLI extensions to deal with the managed classes. Thus the ^ hat. The native C++ interface <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh855364.aspx" rel="nofollow">is here</a>. Harder to find good examples, but this is C++. It is supposed to be harder, otherwise anybody could do it. —
0 Smart programmers, who want exception-safe and bug-free code. Raw pointers have few advantages, <i>particularly</i> as return values and class members. —
0 If you feel you can do better than the JDK programmers themselves, maybe you should apply for a job at Oracle? —
1 Questions about design suit better in the <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/">programmers</a> site. SO is meant to be a place to ask pure technical questions. —
0 You should <a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gettext.git/tree/gettext-tools/its" rel="nofollow">have a look</a> at how relatively complicated specifying extraction rules in ITS (which is, as far as complexity goes, a problem identical to extracting from JOSN) is, even for simple files, before making categorical, but sadly uninformed, pronouncements about how &quot;fairy easy&quot; it is. It isn't comparable to <code>-kgetmethelocalization</code> at all, neither implementation-wise nor from user's POV. But if you still think it's so easy, we lesser programmers would sure appreciate your contribution to GNU gettext to handle JSON ;-) —
0 Its an important situation that experienced programmers and developers can answer this question that you can find them here in Stack;) —
0 You're the one who claimed that anyone who disagrees with you is weird, Dolda. Real world programmers regularly use <code>&amp;&amp;</code> to work with boolean expressions, and <code>&amp;</code> for bitwise operations, and using one where the other is normally used is misleading, and therefore a source of hard-to-find bugs. You are therefore encouraging a beginner to adopt a bad habit that will be rejected out-of-hand in most professional code reviews. The fact that nm17 feels the need to add a comment to explain using <code>&amp;</code> over <code>&amp;&amp;</code> to his tutor makes the content of that comment part of the &quot;bandwidth&quot;. —
0 @chux: I wish there were a standardized dialect of &quot;mainstream&quot; C, which could be used by programmers who aren't targeting obscure DSPs or other devices. While it's useful to have a form of C available for such devices, they shouldn't be allowed to disrupt the development of a language suitable for mainstream computers to the extent that they do. —
0 This is a very awkward way to use <code>typedef</code>. It is not strictly incorrect, but highly unusual and most programmers will be wondering why you code even compiles. —
1 This kind of topic would be more appropriate on the &quot;programmers&quot; site ... except that it has most likely been asked and answered before, and the reasons are the same for almost any new programming language. Basically, this is not a technical question. Rather it is a decision for &gt;&gt;IT management&lt;&lt; who have the responsibility to take the long view. —
0 This doesn't actually match the supplied code - there is no default and test isn't handled. It is shorter, but isn't (arguably) more readable to novice programmers. —
0 The point I was trying to make is that C didn't implement a lot of the things that languages did now because a lot of them didn't exist at the time, or because they weren't considered necessary for &quot;real programmers&quot; (those that used C). In fact, at the time C was popular, there were a lot of developers around who thought it was too high level and that real programmers didn't use it - they wrote assembly code instead. You can't reasonably ask for documentation about why a committee didn't choose to implement something that didn't exist at the time. C != C# (or even C++). —
0 If you are using a version control system like GIT, you could put the <code>client_secret.json</code>-file in your <code>.gitignore</code>-file, and give all your colleagues access to the Google Developer Console, and have them download it from there. Or you could keep a copy on a USB device and give it manually to the programmers in your office, or store it in environment variables in a production setting. —
0 @LogicStuff can you interpret this in simple terms? I am not a programming major and do not speak the language of programmers yet (: —
1 @CodeCaster That is fair but I find it an interesting question so I thought I will try. I will search in programmers SE (was not aware of it) and if no I will try it there. —
0 30-60 seconds is a very long time and eliminates the obvious. There are only two kinds of issues that could cause such a delay. Network timeouts are around 45 seconds, but should be eliminated when you configure CO to not look for updates. Next one is the common plague, the shrink-wrapped malware that programmers voluntarily install. Disable your anti-malware product and try again. —
0 There are real world environments where returning from <code>main()</code> does not deallocate memory. Not everyone uses operating systems that clean up after processes. In the long run, programmers who rely on the host system cleaning up their memory get into trouble - for example, when moving code into functions that allocate memory repeatedly, but never release it. —
