Anyone who uses your assembly or new programmers will have no idea why a method that has always worked one way, now works another way.

Now when people see this method, they instantly know it&#39;s doing something that is not default behavior.");

More relevant is whether or not it is a good idea to begin with despite what other developers might expect. If it is a good idea, good developers will be capable of comprehending, appreciating, and even adopting it.

For instance, if I where to use objects of a mutex guard class, I couldn&#39;t do the unlocking in the guard class&#39;s `__del__` method, because it&#39;s not enough to know that `__del__` will get called when ever the GC feels like doing its job ... I need the mutex released right when the guard object &quot;goes out of scope&quot; (I know that&#39;s stretching it, given Python&#39;s scoping rules).\nIMO `__del__` gives programmers the false impression that RAII in Python is doable via destructors when it really isn&#39;t. You have to use context managers for that.");
